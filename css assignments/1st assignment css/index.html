   Quaid-e-Azam had started taking interest in politics during his stay in London. So, 
   he left his practice of law and joined the Indian National Congress. He wanted to unite 
   the Hindus and the Muslims against the English. But he felt that the Hindus
  Leaders were trying to safeguard their own interests. He decided to join the All Indian Muslim League.
  He worked for a separate homeland for the Muslims. He presented his demands of the 
  Muslims of India in his fourteen points. These demands were rejected by the Congress.
  But he did not lose heart. He was a man of strong will. He had to face a large number
  of hardships but he remained firm to his stand. The Muslim League passed a resolution demanding a 
  separate homeland for the Muslims. There were many difficulties in his way but he never considered them 
  a hindrance in his way to progress. He was as firm as a rock and always showed strong will at all occasions.

  were crowned with success. The dream of Pakistan became a reality on the 14th of August 1947. He became the 
  1st Governor -General of Pakistan. He worked very hard for the progress of the country.
  Quaid-e-Azam was a thin and lean man but he had great qualities of head and heart. He was a great politician.
  He was courageous and fearless. He was a man of principle. He was a peace-loving person. 
  He always wanted to see Pakistan prosperous and powerful. He gave us the message of unity, discipline,
  and faith. He worked day and night with determination. His health failed and he died on the 11th of September,
  1948. But his services for the Muslims of subcontinent will keep him alive in our hearts. Now we are duty-bound 
  to work hard, serve Pakistan and to thank God</p>
